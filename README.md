# Human-in-the-loop AI Content Generator

Welcome! This repo contains a project built for the https://awslambdahackathon.devpost.com/ hackathon.

## High level

The project has two main solutions:

### AI Content Generator app
- A webpage to allow you to create AI contents e.g. for games, using Bedrock (Anthropic Claude, Titan Image Generator), which you can then approve or reject i.e. a human-in-the-loop in case the AI creates sub-quality content.

### Sample Consumer app
- A mobile responsive webpage to be a "sample consumer" for the content generator i.e. you can use it to play the games.
